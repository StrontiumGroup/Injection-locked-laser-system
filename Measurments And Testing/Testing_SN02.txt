v-Apply ±6V / 100mA -> PwerSup ON -> meas. ±9mA
>- 50Ohm term on inputs
v- U1 out 0V
v- U3 out 0V

>-Apply 100Hz/500mVtt @ slow AC in
v- scope measure rising freq. to signal=356mV (=-3dB); 12.5Khz (high cut-off)
v- measure same signal on Tp2 (U2A-out)
v- scope measure decreasing freq. to signal=356mV (=-3db); 15Hz (lo ccut-off)

>-turn potmeter far left (is max gain; trimpot wrong wired)
>-Apply 100Khz/500mVtt @ fast AC in
v-scope measure rising freq. to signal=356mV (=-3dB); 1.8Mhz (high cut-off)
v-scope measure decreasing freq. to signal=356mV (=-3db); 600Hz (lo ccut-off)

>-Apply pos. curren 3V / 50mA
>- connect yellow led
v- At both input 0V measure 1.28V over Source res. 620R -> (=2mA)

>-Apply 2Vtt at slow input
v-measure Vtt over Rsource; 1.52V

>-Apply 2Vtt at Fast input
v-measure Vtt over Rsource; ~1.52V
